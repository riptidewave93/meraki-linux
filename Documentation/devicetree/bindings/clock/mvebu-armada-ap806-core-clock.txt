* Clock bindings for Marvell MVEBU AP806 Core clocks

The Marvell MVEBU Armada 7K/8K SoCs contain a block called AP806,
hosting the CPU and other core components of the CPU. This Device Tree
binding allows to describe the core clocks of the AP806, whose
frequencies are determined by reading the Sample-At-Reset (SAR)
register.

Clock consumers must specify the desired clock by having the clock ID
in its "clocks" phandle cell.

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names for the core
Armada AP806 clocks:

 0 = DDR
 1 = Ring
 2 = CPU

Required properties:
- compatible: must be be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-ap806-core-clock"
- reg: must be the register address of the Sample-At-Reset (SAR) register
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1
- clock-output-names: name of the output clocks

Example:

	coreclk: clk@0x6F8204 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-ap806-core-clock";
		reg = <0x6F8204 0x04>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "ddr", "ring", "cpu";
	};
