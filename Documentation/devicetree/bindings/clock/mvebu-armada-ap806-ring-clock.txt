* Clock bindings for Marvell MVEBU AP806 Ring clocks

The Marvell MVEBU Armada 7K/8K SoCs contain a block called AP806,
hosting the CPU and other core components of the CPU. This Device Tree
binding allows to describe the ring clocks of the AP806, which are
derived from the Ring Core clock, after a dividing factor.

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names on Armada
AP806 RING dividers:

 0 = Ring 0
 1 = Ring 2
 2 = Ring 3
 3 = Ring 4
 4 = Ring 5

Required properties:
- compatible: must be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-ap806-ring-clock"
- reg: must be the register holding the divider values for ring clocks
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1
- clock-output-names: name of the output clocks

Example:

	ringclk: clk@0x6F8250 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-ap806-ring-clock";
		reg = <0x6F8250 0x04>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
		clock-output-names = "ring-0", "ring-2", "ring-3", "ring-4", "ring-5";
		clocks = <&coreclk 1>;
	};
