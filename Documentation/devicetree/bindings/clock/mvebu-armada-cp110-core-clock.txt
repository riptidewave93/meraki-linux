* Clock bindings for Marvell MVEBU CP110 Core clocks

The Marvell MVEBU Armada 7K/8K SoCs contain a block called CP110,
hosting slow and high speed peripherals. This Device Tree
binding allows to describe the core clocks of the CP110, whose
frequencies are fixed except for the NAND clock.

Clock consumers must specify the desired clock by having the clock ID
in its "clocks" phandle cell.

The following is a list of provided IDs and clock names for the core
Armada AP806 clocks:

 0 = APLL - The PLL clock. Root of the clock tree
 1 = PPv2 - The Packet processor clock
 2 = EIP  - The encryption engine clock
 3 = Core - The clock of all other consumers (except NAND)
 4 = Nand - The clock of the NAND interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: must be be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-cp110-clock"
- reg: must be the register address of the NAND clock control register
- #clock-cells: from common clock binding; shall be set to 1

Example:

	cp110_clk: clk@0x6F8204 {
		compatible = "marvell,armada-cp110-clock";
		reg = <0x440700 0x4>;
		#clock-cells = <1>;
	};
