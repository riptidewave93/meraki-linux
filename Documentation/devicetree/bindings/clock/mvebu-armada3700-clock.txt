* Clock bindings for Marvell MVEBU Armada3700 SoCs

Armada3700 SoCs usually allow to determine core clock frequencies by
reading the CPU registers. The core clock consumer should
specify the desired clock by having the clock ID in its "clocks" phandle cell.

Also, Marvell Armada3700 allow some peripheral clocks to be gated to save power.The clock
consumer should specify the desired clock by having the clock ID in its
"clocks" phandle cell. The clock ID is directly mapped to the corresponding clock
gating control bit in HW to ease manual clock lookup in datasheet.

In most of the time, the core clock modules have the corresponding gating
control bit, the kernel driver will take the core clock as the parent of
the gating clock, thus, the consumer only need to specify the gating clock ID.

Core Clock Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-3700-core-clock" - For Armada 3700 SoC core clocks
- reg : shall be the register address of the clock related register
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1

Example:

core_clk: core-clocks@13000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-core-clock";
	reg = <0x13000 0x6000>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};

Gated Clock Required properties:
- compatible : shall be one of the following:
	"marvell,armada-3700-north-bridge-gating-clock" - gate clock control for Armada 3700 north bridge
	"marvell,armada-3700-south-bridge-gating-clock" - gate clock control for Armada 3700 south bridge
- reg : shall be the register address of the Clock Gating Control register
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 1

Optional properties:
- clocks : default parent clock phandle and clock specifier.
	(for gate clock control, it's optional to define the parent clock,
	for the clock consumer, it defines the gate clock phandle and clock ID)

Example:

ngateclk: north-bridge-gate-clk@13014 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-north-bridge-gating-clock";
	reg = <0x13014 0x4>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};

sgateclk: south-bridge-gate-clk@18014 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-south-bridge-gating-clock";
	reg = <0x18014 0x4>;
	#clock-cells = <1>;
};

sata0: sata@e0000 {
	compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-ahci";
	reg = <0xe0000 0x2000>;
	interrupts = <0 27 4>;
	clocks = <&ngateclk 3>;
	status = "disabled";
};
