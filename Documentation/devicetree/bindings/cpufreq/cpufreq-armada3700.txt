Armada37XX cpufreq driver
-------------------------

Armada37XX SoC cpufreq driver for CPU frequency scaling.

Required properties:
- interrupts: Interrupt to know the completion of cpu frequency change.
- clocks: CPU core clock to get the base CPU frequency.

Optional properties:
- clock-latency: Clock monitor latency in microsecond.

All the required listed above must be defined under node cpufreq.

Example:
--------
    cpufreq@14000 {
            compatible = "marvell,armada-3700-cpufreq";
            reg = <0x14000 0x1000>;
            interrupts = <GIC_SPI 128 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
            clock-latency = <1000>;
            clocks = <&core_clk 0>;
    }
