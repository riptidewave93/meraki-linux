* Marvell EBU GPIO controller

Required properties:

- compatible : Should be "marvell,orion-gpio", "marvell,mv78200-gpio",
  "marvell,armadaxp-gpio" or "marvell,armada3700-gpio".
  "marvell,orion-gpio" should be used for Orion, Kirkwood, Dove,
  Discovery (except MV78200) and Armada 370.
  "marvell,mv78200-gpio" should be used for the Discovery MV78200.
  "marvel,armadaxp-gpio" should be used for all Armada XP SoCs
  (MV78230, MV78260, MV78460).
  "marvell,armada3700-gpio" should be used for the Discovery Armada3700.

- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device. Only one
  entry is expected, except for the "marvell,armadaxp-gpio" variant
  for which two entries are expected: one for the general registers,
  one for the per-cpu registers.

- interrupts: The list of interrupts that are used for all the pins
  managed by this GPIO bank. There can be more than one interrupt
  (example: 1 interrupt per 8 pins on Armada XP, which means 4
  interrupts per bank of 32 GPIOs).

- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller

- #interrupt-cells: Specifies the number of cells needed to encode an
  interrupt source. Should be two.
  The first cell is the GPIO number.
  The second cell is used to specify flags:
    bits[3:0] trigger type and level flags:
      1 = low-to-high edge triggered.
      2 = high-to-low edge triggered.
      4 = active high level-sensitive.
      8 = active low level-sensitive.

- gpio-controller: Marks the device node as a GPIO controller

- ngpios: Number of GPIOs this controller has

- #gpio-cells: Should be two. The first cell is the pin number. The
  second cell is reserved for flags, unused at the moment.

Optional:
- gpiobase: The base of the GPIO bank, if not defined the base calculated by
  multiplying the bank ID number by MVEBU_MAX_GPIO_PER_BANK (32)
  This option used in Armada-8k SoC, because the GPIOs count is different between banks
  In Armada-70x0: AP-806 has 20 GPIOs and CP-110 has 63 GPIOs that split into 2 banks,
  The base of CP0 bank0 should be 20 (after AP-806 pins) the base of CP0 bank1 should be
  52 (after AP-806, and CP0 bank0 pins)

Example:

		gpio0: gpio@d0018100 {
			compatible = "marvell,armadaxp-gpio";
			reg = <0xd0018100 0x40>,
			    <0xd0018800 0x30>;
			ngpios = <32>;
			gpio-controller;
			#gpio-cells = <2>;
			interrupt-controller;
			#interrupt-cells = <2>;
			interrupts = <16>, <17>, <18>, <19>;
		};
