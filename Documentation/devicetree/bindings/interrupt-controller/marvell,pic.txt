Marvell PIC Interrupt Controller
-----------------------------------------------------
The Marvell PIC interrupt controller is a simple per-cpu
interrupt aggregator. It receives per-cpu interrupts from
several sources and aggregates them to a single interrupt
line on the primary interrupt controller.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "marvell,pic"
- interrupt-controller: Identifies the node as an interrupt controller.
- interrupt-parent : Indicates the node of the parent interrupt controller.
- #interrupt-cells: Number of cells to define interrupts. Should be 1. The cell is the IRQ number.
- #size-cells: The size of the interrupt cell. Should be 1.
- reg: Should contain PIC registers location and length.
- interrupts: Identifies the IRQ nunmber of the parent IRQ controller to which the PIC is connected to.
- irq-mask: Indicates the valid interrupts supported by this instance of PIC.
- int-en-pol: Interrupt mask polarity - 0 means that writing 0 to the pic int-mask reg enables the interrupt.
		Please refer to the functional spec to figure the right polarity for a specific SoC.

Example:

	pic: interrupt-controller@3f0100 {
		compatible = "marvell,pic";
		reg = <0x3f0100 0x10>;
		irq-mask = <0x7001f>;  /* interrupts 0,1,2,3,4,16,17,18 */
		int-en-pol = <0>; /* 0 unmasks / enables the interrupt. */
		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		interrupt-controller;
		interrupt-parent = <&gic>;
		interrupts = <GIC_PPI 12 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	};
