Bindings for i2c ACT2 driver

Required properties:
- compatible : "act2"
- reg : Address of the device on the i2c bus.

Optional properties:
- write_buf_size : 16-bit value. Device has a minumum 48 byte write buffer
  requirement.  Maximum supported write buffer size is 259 bytes. If no buffer
  size is specified, defaults to minimum size. This buffer size is a requirement
  from the TAM library which needs to send commands to the device in one single
  bulk write.

Examples:

	act2@70 {
		compatible = "cisco,act2";
		reg = <0x70>;
		write_buf_size = /bits/ 16 <63>;
	};
