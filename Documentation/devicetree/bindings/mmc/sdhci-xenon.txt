* Marvell sdhci-xenon controller

This file documents differences between the core properties in mmc.txt
and the properties used by the sdhci-xenon drivers.

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "marvell,xenon-sdhci".
- reg:
  one register area for the SDHCI registers.
- interrupts-extended: interrupt number and attributes
- clocks: array of clocks required for SDHCI.
- eMMC Speed Mode:
  If the SDHC slot in use is implemented to connect an eMMC
  card, three  speed modes in below should be explicitly set.
  - mmc-ddr-1_8v: whether support eMMC DDR mode by 1.8 voltage.
  - mmc-hs200-1_8v: whether support eMMC high speed 200 mode by 1.8 voltage.
  - mmc-hs400-1_8v: whether support eMMC high speed 400 mode by 1.8 voltage.
  Besides, since Xenon cannot support 1.2v, three speed modes in below should not be set.
  - mmc-ddr-1_2v: whether support eMMC DDR mode by 1.2 voltage.
  - mmc-hs200-1_2v:  whether support eMMC high speed 200 mode by 1.2 voltage.
  - mmc-hs400-1_2v: whether support eMMC high speed 400 mode by 1.2 voltage.
  If the SDHC slot is for SD/SDIO, eMMC speed mode should not be set.
- Slot Index
  Xenon can support multiple slots in a single IP. Each SDHC
  slot has its own setting bits.
  The specific slot index in Xenon IP should be provided.
  - xenon,slotno = <slot_index>;
- bus-width: max bus width in unit of bit, normally should be 1 bit, 4 bits or 8 bits
- tuning-count: tuning shift.

Optional properties:
- re-tuning counter
  Tuning counter is only necessary in the speed modes which require re-tuning, such as H200, SDR104 and SDR50.
  In Linux driver, the re-tuning interval will be 2 ^ (Tuning Counter - 1) seconds.
  Xenon SDHC usually doesn't provide re-tuning counter in capability register 3 bit[11:8], thus need set it in driver.
  This property provides the re-tuning counter.
  - xenon,tuning-count = <count>;
  The valid range of Tuning Counter on Xenon SDHC is [1, 0xE].
  0xF is the default value of Capabilities Register 3 bit[11:8] on Xenon SDHC, which indicates that the Tuning
  Counter should be achieved through another source.
  The selection of Tuning Counter value depends on the board timing and environment.
  More quickly the board timing varies with environment change, more frequently SDHC should execute re-tuning.
  The term board timing also includes the timing characteristic of eMMC/SD/SDIO card.
  If have no idea what value should set, just remove this property in DT file.
  If this property is not set, default re-tuning counter will be set to 0x9 in driver.
- xenon,emmc: whether only used for eMMC mode(does not support SD)
  If the SDHC_SYS_CFG_INFO register (Offset 0x0104) can clearly indicate that the current slot only supports eMMC, this property is optional.
  However, if the SDHC_SYS_CFG_INFO register shows that the current slot can also support SD/SDIO besides of eMMC, this property is mandatory.
  It informs driver that the current slot is used for eMMC.
  If this property is not set, current slot will be used for SD/SDIO.
- non-removable: whether card is non-removable.
- auto-cmd12: whether cmd12 is sent automatically.
Example:

sdhci0: sdhci@D8000 {
	compatible = "marvell,xenon-sdhci";
	reg = <0xD8000 0x300>;
	interrupts-extended = <&gic GIC_SPI 26 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
	mmc-ddr-1_8v;
	mmc-hs200-1_8v;
	mmc-hs400-1_8v;
	xenon,slotno = <0>;
	xenon,emmc;
	non-removable;
	bus-width = <8>;
	auto-cmd12;
	tuning-count = <6>;
	status = "disabled";
};
