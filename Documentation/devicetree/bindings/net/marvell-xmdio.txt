* Marvell xMDIO Ethernet Controller interface

The Ethernet controllers of the Marvel Armada-39x, Armada-7k
and Armada-8k have an identical unit that provides
an interface with the xMDIO bus. This driver handles this xMDIO
interface.

Required properties:
- compatible: "marvell,xmdio"
- reg: address and length of the xSMI register

The child nodes of the xMDIO driver are the individual PHY devices
connected to this xMDIO bus. They must have a "reg" property given the
PHY address on the xMDIO bus.

Example at the SoC level:

mdio {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	compatible = "marvell,xmdio";
	reg = <0x12A600 0x20>;
};

And at the board level:

mdio {
	phy0: ethernet-phy@0 {
		reg = <0>;
	};

	phy1: ethernet-phy@1 {
		reg = <1>;
	};
}
