	  Enables support for linux in-tree drivers for Intel's
	  QuickAssist Technology (QAT). These do not have support
	  for Monster Mash (mx250b, mx450b) HW crypto offload.

	  Enabling this for Monster Mash builds will greatly reduce
	  VPN throughput performance, and cannot be used in combination
	  with QAT1.7 which does support Monser Mash.
